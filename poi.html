            <p class="mounteverest2">Mount Everest is the highest peak of the world located in Nepal. Using the best equipment of the day, it is determined that it stood 29,029 feet above sea level, which remains the official altitude recognized by both the Nepali and Chinese governments to this day. The first people to climb the Everest are Tenzin Norgay and Edmund Hillary. The Mount Everest is called "Sagarmatha" in Nepali language which translates to the Goddess of the Sky.

            <p>SwambhuNath is an ancient religious architecture atop a hill in the Kathmandu Valley. The stupa has Buddha's eyes and eyebrows painted on. Between them, the number one (in Devanagari script) is painted in the fashion of a nose. There are also shops, restaurants and hostels. The site has two access points: a long staircase leading directly to the main platform of the temple, which is from the top of the hill to the east; and a car road around the hill from the south leading to the south-west entrance. It takes about 20-30 mins to walk up the stairs to the top.

            <p class="rajam2">Located off the northwest tip of Bird's Head Peninsula on the island of New Guinea, in Indonesia's West Papua province, Raja Ampat, or the Four Kings, is an archipelago comprising over 1,500 small islands, cays, and shoals surrounding the four main islands of Misool, Salawati, Batanta, and Waigeo, and the smaller island of Kofiau. The Raja Ampat archipelago is the part of Coral Triangle which contains the richest marine biodiversity on earth. Most of the archipelago is in the Southern Hemisphere, with a few small islands northwest of Waigeo such as Sajang Island in the Northern Hemisphere. Some of the islands are the northernmost parts of the Australian continent.

            <img src="img/indo_tanahlot.jpg" alt="Tanah Lot">
            <p>Tanah Lot is claimed to be the work of the 16th-century Dang Hyang Nirartha. During his travels along the south coast he saw the rock-island's beautiful setting and decided to rest there. Some fishermen saw him, and bought him gifts. Nirartha then spent the night on the little island. Later he spoke to the fishermen and told them to build a shrine on the rock, for he felt it to be a holy place to worship the Balinese sea gods.The main deity of the temple is Dewa Baruna or Bhatara Segara, who is the sea god or sea power and these days, Nirartha is also worshipped here.
